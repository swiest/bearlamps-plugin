  A Bear Lamp eXtreme feedback device aggregates the current status of jobs contained in a single view.
  Just collect all jobs to be monitored in a single Jenkins view and up you go! You can have multiple views,
  each controlling its own set of bears.

  <p>
    The bear lamps are updated <em>only once per minute</em>. This interval protects the energy saving lamps
    inside the bears from being switched too rapidly.
